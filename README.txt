1. INTRODUCTION

  The GPstuff toolbox is a versatile collection of Gaussian process
  models and computational tools required for inference. The tools
  include, among others, various inference methods, sparse
  approximations and model assessment methods.

  The GPstuff toolbox works (at least) with Matlab versions r2009b
  (7.9) or newer (older versions down to 7.7 should work also, but the
  code is not tested with them). Most of the functionality works also
  with Octave (3.6.4 or newer, see release notes for details). GPstuff
  can also be called from R with RcppOctave package. Most of the code
  is written in m-files but some of the most computationally critical
  parts have been coded in C.

  The code for GPstuff can be found in subfolders. The SuiteSparse
  folder contains an exact copy of the SuiteSparse v3.4 toolbox by Tim
  Davis:
  http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/SuiteSparse/current/SuiteSparse/
  The SuiteSparse is needed when using compactly supported covariance
  functions.

2. INSTALLING THE TOOLBOX

  If Matlab or Octave is started in root directory of GPstuff,
  startup.m script will add GPstuff subdirectories to the
  path. Alternatively, see startup.m for paths to add.

  Some of the functions in GPstuff are implemented using C in order to
  make the computations faster. In order to use these functions you
  need to compile them first. There are two ways to do that:

  1) Basic installation without compactly supported covariance
     functions

  * Install the GPstuff package by running gpstuff_install in this
    folder

  * With this option you are able to use all the other functions
    except for gpcf_ppcs*


  2) Installation with compactly supported covariance functions
  
  Compactly supported (CS) covariance functions are functions that
  produce sparse covariance matrices (matrices with zero elements). To
  use these functions (gpcf_ppcs*) you need the sparse GP
  functionalities in GPstuff which are build over SuiteSparse
  toolbox. To take full advantage of the CS covariance functions
  install GPstuff by running gpstuff_install('SuiteSparseOn' ) in the
  present directory.

    The function gpstuff_install compiles the mex-files and prints on
    the screen, which directories should be added to Matlab paths. 
    
3. CONTENTS
   
   The GPstuff packge contains the following subdirectories:
   diag  dist  gp  mc  misc  optim  test_gpstuff  SuiteSparse

   Each folder contains Contents.m, which summarizes the functions
   in the folder. 

   The 'gp' folder contains the main functionalities and demonstration
   programs. Other folders contain additional help functions.

4. TESTING THE INSTALLATION

   Installation can be tested by running command run_tests, which
   runs specific demos and compares the computed results to pre-saved
   results.

5. USER QUIDE (VERY SHORT)

   It easiest to learn to use the package by running the demos. It is
   advisable to open the demo files in text editor and run them line
   by line. The demos are documented so that user can follow what
   happens on each line.

   The basic structure of the program is as follows. The program
   consist of separate blocks, which are:

      Gaussian process model structure (GP):
                      This is a structure that contains all the
                      model information (see GP_SET) and information
                      on, which inference scheme is used. 

                      GP structure contains covariance function
                      structures (GPCF_*) and likelihood structures
                      (LIK_*). 

      Covariance function structure (GPCF):
                      This is a structure that contains all of the
                      covariance function information (see
                      e.g. GPCF_SEXP). The structure contains the
                      hyperparameter values, pointers to nested
                      functions that are related to the covariance
                      function (e.g. function to evaluate covariance
                      matrix) and hyperprior structure.

      Likelihood structure:
                      This is a structure that contains all of the
                      likelihood function information (see
                      e.g. likelih_probit). The structure contains the
                      likelihood parameter values and pointers to
                      nested functions that are related to the
                      likelihood function (e.g. log likelihood and its
                      derivatives).

      Inference utilities:
                      Inference utilities consist of functions that
                      are needed to make the posterior inference and
                      predictions. These include, among others,
		        GP_OPTIM - Find MAP estimate for hyperparameters
                        GP_MC - Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling
                        GP_IA - Integration approximations
			GP_PRED - Predictions with Gaussian Process
